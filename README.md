## 🌟 About Me

Hello! I’m a Human Resource Management student with a strong foundation in:

- Talent Acquisition & Employer Branding  
- Employee Engagement & Organizational Culture  
- HR Analytics (Excel, Power BI – beginner)  
- Performance Management Systems  

I’m currently working on building a bridge between **HR theory** and **practical, real-world application**—through case studies, research projects, and productivity systems. My long-term goal is to become an **HR leader** who enables inclusive, data-driven, and purpose-focused workplaces.
